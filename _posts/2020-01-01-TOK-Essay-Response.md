Within areas of knowledge, how can we differentiate between change and progress? Answer with reference to two areas of knowledge.

“Progress” is an axiological or a normative concept, which should be distinguished from such neutral descriptive terms as “change” and “development”[^1] In normal terms, we as knowers ought to concern ourselves with progress for the sake of creating a specific future. This is a deeply modern idea: we all want to be on the cusp of a better tomorrow, endlessly striving for a marginally better tomorrow. This intention leeks over to thought itself; To know better is to do better. “What forms of change are qualified as progressive? How can we know which forms of knowledge to promote, in order to gain progress?” we may ask. To discover a new future this question must be settled. What will become clear in this discussion is that, because of the veil of the contemporary epoch, change is incredibly difficult to identify as progress on a short term basis. Instead, we must study how knowledge systems have quickly undergone expansions to their scopes, methods, and modes over time.
A competing model for understanding progress as distinct from change is the “progress as a form of change” theory. What quickly arises though, is the problem of momentous change as unprogressive, or minute changes as extremely progressive overtime. Knowers are rendered incapable, at least in the short term, to distinguish their progress in a field from a mere transformation, beyond a simple move towards a political ideal. We stagnate under this theory, since all knowledge is seen as relative and only liable to the judgement of history. However, from this problematic theory arises the possibility of epistemological technology: that is to say, knowledge of how an area of knowledge operates, expands, or contracts can enable us as knowers to manipulate those areas for our utopian goals.
We will soon find that the process of History is analogous to its study. But first let us ask: How does knowledge of history allow us to create a new future? Marx, in his study of the Napoleons, gives us an insight “Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.”[^2] Indeed, it can be said that the normative study of history is essentially farce making: mimicking past events with new and perverted justifications or mimicking past justifications in new perverse events. To illustrate, at the 1974 Special Session of the U.N. General Assembly, Deng Xiaoping gave a speech which used Maoist ideology of anti-imperialism to justify privatizing the Chinese economy[^3] . In other words, he used the ancienne Maoist justifications of “contradiction” to reify his project. In this way, he fails to depart from either the ideology of capitalism or communism, and instead simply creates a nominal “change.”
But in the end, what does it mean to depart from and progress beyond two antagonistic forces? This question is one of extreme import if we are to apply the knowledge borne by history, and construct a *present* as the children of the past. In fact, we may come to terms with the idea that History is a progression of opposing elements which develop alongside one another. As knowers, it is our job to find the weaknesses and strengths that align with our ideals and exploit them tirelessly in a political project. In his revolutionary project *A People’s History Of The United States, *Howard Zinn writes that American history is one of struggle between those who have “no respect for human rights or constitutional liberties” and those who fight politically for the tenets of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Both groups of individuals have throughout time adapted and manifested, calculated and recalculated, all the while becoming more extreme and diverse alongside one another. Knowing history, in this light, entails a certain tactic: one of oppression or emancipation. Analogously, Dr. Ibram X. Kendi argues that racist and anti-racist ideologies have mutually progressed[^4] . He cites the onset of racist poll taxes after electoral mobilization by the black liberation movement, and black political prisonhood after the decriminalization of enslavement, as being political action and reactions. The study of history, therefore, should not be viewed as some impersonal catalog of the facts. Contrarily, by documenting and debating history, we imply a departure from it. We as knowers declare in a very radical way that the struggle of one element or another throughout time will live on in us, and thus we simultaneously embody progress. History is progressive insofar as its study realizes the development of a transcendent utopia, but only as the prevention of an evermore imminent dystopia. Knowers can distinguish progress from change through the study of history, as they watch the prevalence of their ideal grow in unprecedented magnitude.
Perhaps we should begin by assuming Natural Science knowledge systems behave the same way - here being that through the “political” acts of data driven studies, high research output, and rigorously documented findings, we achieve the utopic outcome of scientific “advancement.” One such advancement in the near past, which caused a massive broadening of the scope and scale of knowledge in the natural sciences, was the discovery of quantum mechanics by physicists. After cathode rays were discovered, the black-body radiation problem was outlined; in response, more research led to the suggestion that energy states of particles could be discrete, they were modeled, and then photons were discovered. The work of 70 years culminated in an understanding of the elementary dynamics of quantum mechanics, whose groundbreaking technological applications in computer science (and particularly cryptography) can hardly be qualified as non-progressive.
But this discovery was hardly incremental. Actually, paradigms in science are shifted through massive imagination on the parts of audacious researchers: scientists who break the rules of “observation then hypothesis” in preference for hypothesis first, or who otherwise do “bad” science. They imagine a better world, one with a better understanding of an imagined concept, and then they prove their imagined solution to be true. Over time, we forgive their risk because it stands the test of rigor, reproduction, and time, and we perceive their work as progressive because it expands our horizons, even if it disrespected the methodologies of our area of knowledge. In the case of quantum mechanics,  Ludwig Boltzmann, in his postulation that energy states could be discrete, broke entirely with the paradigm of determinism in physics, in favor of probabilistic ones for prediction. Rather than tweaking the understanding of the day, by solving some absurdly trivial equation, or applying knowledge to some small sphere of human existence, this change proved different[^5] . In fact, it proved that “Bad science” can actually be progressive. While quality may be important in sustainable scientific change, one can  reject current paradigms of science  and make significant progress in advancing our horizon of understanding.
As Thomas Kuhn argues, progress also occurs when a change to a knowledge system begins to solve problems which the previous paradigm was unfit to address. The example which comes to mind is Peter Kropotkin’s theory of mutual aid evolution, which competes with Darwinian evolutionary theory. Kropotkin proposes that ecological systems change over time not with the forces of competition and selection, but rather under the mechanisms of cooperative action. Kropotkin accounts for symbiosis between organisms in his analysis, which was hitherto unexplained in the Darwinian school of thought, and answers the piling questions of non-selective ecological environments. Knowledge is technological in this way; it allows knowers to solve new problems, which the previous paradigm was unwilling or unable to address. But this does not always coincide with a wholesale rejection of the previous knowledge framework. Darwinian evolution still accounts for many situations, corroborating itself by mapping a specific territory of knowledge. Nonetheless, a new “map” has been charted, new problems can be anticipated and subsequently solved, and even more holes in the consensus understanding are found.
The ideals of epistemic progress operate differently between History and the Natural Sciences. Whereas history embeds a system of political justification and falsification into a seemingly benign and apolitical task of  “documentation,” the natural sciences purport to study phenomena which are related to the production of political technologies for the sake of  “the pursuit of knowledge.” Both systems, however, share an implicit connection to ethics: a more “known” world is a better one. Here, a more radical approach to the progress/change conversation erupts. “Change” in its rudimentary form is a way of sidestepping the epistemological, political, and ethical implications of one's theory, by way of refurbishment or revitalisation; it is an attempt both in history and the natural sciences to appease critics with a “new” theory/technology which accounts for the issues, without addressing the root causes of the problem. Progress, on the other hand, is an acceptance of the implications of the theory, and an alignment between the utopia attempted and the world created by a form of knowledge.
Progress, throughout time, has been demarcated and defined by the rules of the epoch and its categories. Particularly, the questions we are fit to answer and the ones we are yet too meek to ask have waxed and waned with the years. In the study of history, not only does the salience of particular ideals constitute progress, but also the relationships between those values (epistemological, ethical, political, etc.) and the people who practice them. By studying, we position ourselves as agents of progress, whether that be the continuation of democracy, the elimination of oppression, or any other political agenda. By studying, we position ourselves as scientifically progressive by becoming aware of those phenomena as yet not understood and broadening the scope of the natural sciences in order to explain them.
